# Impacts on Society

(Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level. Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course)

**Apps That Help Others and Build Empathy**

**Grade Level:** 9 - 12

**Description:**
In this lesson, students will watch videos, read articles, and engage in activities related to specific disabilities and illnesses, the challenges people with different health conditions face, and how new technologies are helping people who have these conditions in their lives.
For the assessment, students will invent an app that helps someone in their school or community and raises empathy for others.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/

- Students learn how apps can improve people's lives and raise empathy.
- Students explore the connection between innovation and empathy
- Students create an app using the invention process. 

### Learning Activities

(Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?)

**Activate Prior Knowledge**

Ask students if they have heard the slogan “There’s an app for that”? Apple coined it back in 2009, in what we would now consider the early days of app technology. Since then, apps have become an everyday part of life. 
Have students write brief responses to the following questions. Have students share their responses. Write their responses on the board. 
1. What apps do you use? 
2. What purpose do they serve? 
3. Do you use any apps that make your life easier?
4. Can you think of an app that raises your awareness around important issues in your community? An app that improves people’s lives and builds empathy?

Have students watch this video [Ethan Harris]https://studentreportinglabs.org/youth-reporting/student-hopes-to-help-those-with-same-genetic-disorder/ and have them write brief responses to these questions:
1. What specific challenges does Ethan deal with his daily life?
2. How does Ethan deal with these challenges and help others with cystic fibrosis?
3. In what ways does Ethan show empathy for others?

Have students share with their partner before share out loud.

Have students watch this video to learn more about why [Emma Yang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FX9kZigpjc) created the app and how it would help people with Alzheimer’s. After watching, have students write brief responses to the following questions: 
1. Based on what you saw in the video, what skills and qualities does Emma possess that helped her develop her app?
2. How could an app like Timeless help Alzheimer's patients and their families connect with one another?

Have students share with their partner before share out loud.


### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.
Students will create an app (no coding necessary) using the [invention process.]https://contrib.pbslearningmedia.org/WGBH/conv18/adptech12_int_idsprocess/index.html



### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
