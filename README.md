# Impacts on Society

**Name:** Apps That Help Others and Build Empathy

**Grade Level:** 9 - 12.

**Duration:** 5 - 7 days

**Description:**
In this lesson, students will watch videos and engage in activities related to specific disabilities and illnesses, the challenges people with different health conditions face, and how new technologies are helping people who have these conditions in their lives.

**Notes**

Students should be working in pairs throughout the lesson, and they should keep an individual journal where you can monitor their progress and check for understanding.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives**

- Learn how apps can improve people's lives and raise empathy.
- Explore the connection between innovation and empathy
- Invent an app using the invention process. 
- Create a 30-second “elevator pitch” to persuade someone to invest money in their app.

### Learning Activities

**Day 1: How Empathy Leads to Innovation**

Ask students if they have heard the slogan “There’s an app for that”? Apple coined it back in 2009. Since then, apps have become an everyday part of life. 

Have students write brief responses to the following questions. Share with their partner before sharing with the class.

1. What apps do you use? 

2. What purpose do they serve? 

3. Do you use any apps that make your life easier?

4. Can you think of an app that raises your awareness around important issues in your community? An app that improves people’s lives and builds empathy?

**Video 1:** [Ethan Harris](https://studentreportinglabs.org/youth-reporting/student-hopes-to-help-those-with-same-genetic-disorder/). 
Tell students that as they watch, think about the challenges Ethan faces, how his story builds empathy in others, and how he defies stereotypes of what it is like to live with a disability. After watching the video, have student write brief responses to the following questions. Share with their partner before sharing with the class. 

1. What specific challenges does Ethan deal with in his daily life?

2. How does Ethan deal with these challenges and help others with cystic fibrosis?

3. In what ways does Ethan show empathy for others?

**Video 2:** [Emma Yang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FX9kZigpjc). 
Tell students that Emma Yang, a teenager from New York City, designed an app that would help people living with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.
After watching the video, have students write brief responses to the following questions. Share with their partner before sharing with the class.

1. Based on what you saw in the video, what skills and qualities does Emma possess that helped her develop her app?
2. How could an app like Timeless help Alzheimer's patients and their families connect with one another?

**Day 2: Invention Process: Turn Your Idea into Reality**

Ask students if they know what is the invention process?
Have students watch the [Invention Process](https://contrib.pbslearningmedia.org/WGBH/conv18/adptech12_int_idsprocess/index.html).
Review common note-taking techniques with student. Have students take notes of the five steps in the Invention Process. 

**Invention Process**

**Step 1:** Identify the Problem

**Step 2:** Brainstorm Solutions

**Step 3:** Invent a Solution

**Step 4:** Build, Test and Evaluate, and Redesign Solution

**Step 5:** Share Solution

To show the connection between the steps in Invention Process and steps for Building App. 
Provide an example of a made-up App, where steps for Building App match the steps of the Invention Process.

**Steps for Building App**

**Step 1:** You asked the cafeteria for a list of ingredients they use but were told they don’t post it.

**Step 2:** Think of various ways the school cafeteria could share its list of ingredients.

**Step 3:** Make an outline of how the cafeteria should publish its ingredients, costs involved, and how it helps students.

**Step 4:** Sketch or build a prototype; seek out feedback; make necessary changes.

**Step 5:** Post your design on social media.

**Assessment:** You may want to play a matching game where they have to arrange the steps in order and match correctly the "Steps for Invention Process" with "Steps for Building App"

**Day 3: Inventing an App that Solves a Real-World Problem**

**Video 3:** [Ryan Hudson-Peralta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDHXMfnjqjI). Tell students to listen to Ryan's story and reflect on how he has inspired thosed around him. After watching, have students answer these questions. Share with their partner before sharing with the class.

1. What are three ways that Ryan has confronted challenges?

2. What are three ways that Ryan has inspired others?

**Video 4:** [Archer Hadley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh1a_juMMoo). 

Tell students, as they watch the video learn more about Archer’s efforts to make his high school more accessible for people living with disabilities. Think about how the wheelchair challenge raises empathy for those with disabilities. 

Tell students to think about Ryan and Archer's stories in mind, think about a problem in their community or school that affects people living with a disability or illness. 
Students will create an app (no coding necessary) by responding to questions and prompts related to steps in the design process.

**Identify a Problem:** In your school or community, what poses a problem for those living with a disability or illness?

**Brainstorm:** Write down a few ideas that pop into your head, even outside-the-box ideas, which could potentially solve the problem.

**Create:** From the list of ideas you generated, which idea is the most realistic to accomplish?

**Build, Test & Evaluate, and Redesign:** What is one strategy you learned from the stories featured in this lesson that might help you come up with your solution?

**Share Your Invention:** With whom would you like to share your solution? Think of both individuals and groups of people

**Days 4 - 6: Final Writing Assignment - The Elevator Pitch**

Tell students that their final assignment is to write an elevator pitch for a new app that helps solve a problem in their school/community and builds empathy.
Explain that elevator pitch is same amount of time to explain and convince someone of a good idea as it does to ride up or down several floors in an elevator.

Tell students that the pitch should take about 30–60 seconds to deliver, and they will use Flipgrid to record it. They should use engaging language that will capture their audience’s interest and convince stakeholders that their app is well worth the investment.

First, have students create an outline that should address the following:
- The main purpose of the app
- Who your app helps
- How your app works

Second, have students write and practice their pitch in front of a classmate. 

Third, have students record their elevator pitch using Flipgrid.

**Day 7: Peer Review or Reflection**

You may have students do peer review or have students write their responses to the following questions:
- What did you learn?
- What was surprising?
- What questions do you still have?
- What was the easiest for you to understand and do? What was the most difficult?

### Assessments
Use the rubric below for assessing multiple assignments: 

**1. Elevator pitch adopts appropriate format and delivery.**
- Excellent: Provides a clear and accurate response to the question in a well-organized format that follows the instruction laid out for how to write an elevator pitch.  

- Good: Provides an adequate response to the question in the format that follows the elevator pitch structure.  

- Fair: Provides a generally accurate response to the question in the format that follows part of the elevator pitch structure.  

- Poor: Provides an inaccurate response to the question or fails to address the question. May include misinterpretations. Understanding of the topic is not apparent. 

**2. Invention demonstrates innovation and applies iterative design.**
- Excellent: Designs an invention that demonstrates a clear understanding of the invention process. 

- Good: Designs an invention that demonstrates an adequate understanding of the the invention process.   

- Fair: Designs an invention that demonstrates a generally accurate understanding of the invention process. 

- Poor: Designs an invention that demonstrates an inaccurate understanding of the invention process.


**3. Apps improve people's lives, raise empathy and potential impacts on society.**

- Excellent: Demonstrates a clear understanding how apps improve people's lives, raise empathy and its potential impacts on society. 

- Good: Demonstrates an adequate understanding how apps improve people's lives, raise empathy and its potential impacts on society.

- Fair: Demonstrates a generally accurate understanding how apps improve people's lives, raise empathy and its potential impacts on society.

- Poor: Demonstrates an inaccurate understanding how apps improve people's lives, raise empathy and its potential impacts on society. 

In addition to the final assignment, the work that students do throughout the lesson should be monitored so that it serves as part of a formative assessment. Student’s participation in class discussion may also be included too.

### Outcomes

App development is big business and new apps by aspiring entrepreneurs and inventors continue to come out each day. Some of the best apps involve ways to improve peoples's lives. They can also build empathy. I hope that after watching these videos, students would have a better understanding and empathy for people with specific disabilities and illnesses.
