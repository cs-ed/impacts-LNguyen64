# Impacts on Society

**Apps That Help Others and Build Empathy**

**Grade Level:** 9 - 12
**Duration:** 3 - 5 days

**Description:**
In this lesson, students will watch videos and engage in activities related to specific disabilities and illnesses, the challenges people with different health conditions face, and how new technologies are helping people who have these conditions in their lives.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

- Students learn how apps can improve people's lives and raise empathy.
- Students explore the connection between innovation and empathy
- Students create an app (no coding necessary) using the invention process. 

### Learning Activities

**Activate Prior Knowledge**

Ask students if they have heard the slogan “There’s an app for that”? Apple coined it back in 2009. Since then, apps have become an everyday part of life. 
Have students write brief responses to the following questions. Share with their table partner before share with the class.
1. What apps do you use? 
2. What purpose do they serve? 
3. Do you use any apps that make your life easier?
4. Can you think of an app that raises your awareness around important issues in your community? An app that improves people’s lives and builds empathy?

**How Empathy Leads to Innovation**

Show video 1: [Ethan Harris.](https://studentreportinglabs.org/youth-reporting/student-hopes-to-help-those-with-same-genetic-disorder/). Tell students that as they watch, think about the challenges Ethan faces, how his story builds empathy in others, and how he defies stereotypes of what it is like to live with a disability.
After watching the video, have student write brief responses to the following questions. Share with their table partner before sharing with the class. 
1. What specific challenges does Ethan deal with his daily life?
2. How does Ethan deal with these challenges and help others with cystic fibrosis?
3. In what ways does Ethan show empathy for others?

Show video 2: [Emma Yang.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FX9kZigpjc). Tell students that Emma Yang, a teenager from New York City, designed an app that would help people living with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers. Alzheimer's is a neurological disease that affects a person’s memory and decreases one’s ability to carry out daily functions.
After watching the video, have students write brief responses to the following questions. Share with their table partner before sharing with the class.
1. Based on what you saw in the video, what skills and qualities does Emma possess that helped her develop her app?
2. How could an app like Timeless help Alzheimer's patients and their families connect with one another?

**Invention Process: Turn Your Idea into Reality**
Ask students if they know what is the invention process?
To prepare students for their final project, have students watch the [Invention Process](https://contrib.pbslearningmedia.org/WGBH/conv18/adptech12_int_idsprocess/index.html). 
Have them take notes of the five steps in the invention process
Steps of Invention Process:
1. Identify the Problem (IP)
2. Brainstorm Solutions (IP)
3. Invent a Solution (IP)
4. Build, Test and Evaluate, and Redesign Solution (IP)
5. Share Solution (IP)

Also show them an example of a made-up app (APP) where steps for building App match the steps of the invention process
1. You asked the cafeteria for a list of ingredients they use but were told they don’t post it. (App)
2. Think of various ways the school cafeteria could share its list of ingredients.(App)
3. Make an outline of how the cafeteria should publish its ingredients, costs involved, and how it helps students. (App)
4. Sketch or build a prototype; seek out feedback; make necessary changes. (App)
5. Post your design on social media. (App)

Show video 3: [Ryan Hudson-Peralta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDHXMfnjqjI). Tell students to listen to Ryan's story and reflect on how he has inspired thosed around him. After watching, have students answer these questions:
1. What are three ways that Ryan has confronted challenges?
2. What are three ways that Ryan has inspired others?

Show video 4: [Archer Hadley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh1a_juMMoo). Tell students, as they watch the video learn more about Archer’s efforts to make his high school more accessible for people living with disabilities. Think about how the wheelchair challenge raises empathy for those with disabilities. 

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.
Students create an app
Have students work in groups of 2 or 3 (heterogeneous)
Tell students to think about Ryan and Archer's stories in mind, think about a problem in their community or school that affects people living with a disability or illness. 
Students will create an app (no coding necessary) by responding to questions and prompts related to steps in the design process.
Invention Process
**1. Identify a Problem:** In your school or community, what poses a problem for those living with a disability or illness?
**2. Brainstorm:** Write down a few ideas that pop into yur head, even outside-the-box ideas, which could potentially solve the problem.
**3. Create:** From the list of ideas you generated, which idea is the most realistic to accomplish?
**4. Build, Test & Evaluate, and Redesign:** What is one strategy you learned from the stories featured in this lesson that might help you come up with your solution?
**Share Your Invention:** With whom would you like to share your solution? Think of both individuals and groups of people

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.

App development is big business and new apps by aspiring entrepreneurs and inventors continue to come out each day. Some of the best apps involve ways to improve peoples's lives. They can also build empathy. I hope that after watching these videos, students would have a better understanding and empathy for people with
