# Impacts on Society

(Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level. Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course)

**Grade Level:** 6 - 8, 9 - 12

**Apps That Help Others and Build Empathy**
**Description:**
In this lesson, students will learn how apps can improve people’s lives and raise empathy. They begin by watching videos,
reading articles, and engaging in activities to learn about exciting new technologies that have been developed to help
people who have a disability or illness. They also explore the connection between innovation and empathy. Then they will
use this knowledge to apply the design process to conceptualize their own app, which addresses a challenge for someone
living with a disability or illness.


## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/
- Students learn how apps can improve people's lives and raise empathy.
- Students explore the connection between innovation and empathy
- Students create an app (no coding necessary) using the invention process. 


### Learning Activities

(Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?)

Watch this video to learn more about why [Emma Yang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FX9kZigpjc)created the app and how it would help people with Alzheimer’s. After watching, have students write brief responses to the following questions: 
1. Based on what you saw in the video, what skills and qualities does Emma possess that helped her develop her app?
2. How could an app like Timeless help Alzheimer's patients and their families connect with one another?

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.


### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
